# Introduction #
An unique Human Computer Interface with functionality of a Windows Mouse and flexibility of writing your own Windows Driver. It uses _tilt_ to move the mouse on the screen.

You can call it Air-Mouse, we call it _Pigeon!_ :)

The **objective** of this project is:
  * To understand and explore using an accelerometer
  * To make a Human Computer Interface / Human Interface Device
  * Having fun!

# Applications #
  * Use it as a **regular mouse**. The [Video](http://manavkataria.wordpress.com/2009/05/12/pigeon-video/) demonstrates using air-mouse on desktop, a windows application, Internet browsing with Firefox and Google Maps.
  * Super cool experience to **play games** with it. I play [Blaster-ball 3](http://www.wildgames.com/games/blaster-ball-3) :)
  * Immersive, intuitive interaction for **3D applications** like Google-Earth (partly implemented)
  * Like an [Inertial Navigation System](http://code.google.com/p/air-mouse/wiki/InertialNavigationSystem)
  * Future: Use it as an **aid for the disabled**
  * Future: Can provide an Immersive **Virtual Reality** experience
  * Future: Use it to guide a [quadcopter](http://toucharcade.com/2010/01/06/ces-2010-parrot-ar-drone-an-iphone-controlled-quadricopter/) or a car.

# Software #
